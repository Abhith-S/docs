# Important Security Consideration

## **Do not connect your computer directly to the internet without the assistance of a firewall.**

**Make sure you're connected to the Internet through a router and not through a modem without a firewall.**

Our software serves requests from the Internet, but not all software you may have installed is designed to be exposed to the Internet directly. This is especially true for users on Windows with applications responding to requests on all IPs.
