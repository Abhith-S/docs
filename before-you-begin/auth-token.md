# Authorization Token

## Authorization Token

Make sure you have copied your personal single-use authorization token from the [**Node Hosting signup page**](https://www.storj.io/host-a-node). It looks like this:

![The entire string, including your email is your auth token.](../.gitbook/assets/auth-token.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not have an authorization token yet, **** [**sign up to Hosting a node.**](https://registration.storj.io)****
{% endhint %}

By using your authorization token, you agree to the [Storage Node Operator Terms and Conditions](https://storj.io/storj-operator-terms).
