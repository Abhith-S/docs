# Product Overview

Storj DCS (Decentralized Cloud Storage) is an encrypted, secure, and affordable object storage service that enables you to store, back up, and archive large amounts of data to the decentralized cloud.

To learn how files are uploaded to Storj DCS see [how it works](https://storj.io/how-it-works).&#x20;

## How Decentralized Cloud Storage Works

When you upload your data to Storj DCS, your data is encrypted, erasure-coded, and spread across a network of statistically uncorrelated peers (Storage Nodes).
