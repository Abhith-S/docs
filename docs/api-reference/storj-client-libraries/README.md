# Storj Client Libraries

## Getting Started

The `libuplink` developer library is written for the Go language.  This will allow you to integrate with the object store programmatically.&#x20;

`libuplink` contains a number of interesting components, including pre-written code and subroutines, classes, values or type specifications, message templates, configuration walkthroughs, and great documentation.

Storj DCS currently has community contributed bindings for Python, Swift, .Net, PHP, and Node.js. &#x20;

Below are Storj's provided bindings:

* [GO](https://github.com/storj/uplink)
