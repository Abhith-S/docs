# Backup With Restic

## Overview

**Restic** is a backup client written in Go language, it is highly secure and efficient. Each **Restic** backup is a snapshot of the server/files/directory, deduplicated from what was stored before. Any restore to a given backup will restore the server/files/directories to the exact state they were at that time.

This is a quick-start tutorial that covers [Restic](https://restic.net) usage with Storj DCS.&#x20;

In this guide, we will cover only some of the basic features of the tool.  The complete documentation for Restic is located here, at their [complete command reference](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual\_rest.html).

{% hint style="danger" %}
This guide is experimental. The main functionality appears to work, but there are expected to be undiscovered issues. Please report any issues you may run into on this [forum thread](https://forum.storj.io/t/two-more-tech-previews-rclone-and-restic/6072).
{% endhint %}

## Before you begin

If you haven't yet, create a Storj DCS account before following the rest of the tutorial.

{% content-ref url="../getting-started/quickstart-uplink-cli/prerequisites.md" %}
[prerequisites.md](../getting-started/quickstart-uplink-cli/prerequisites.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You will need the following:

* [x] Install and configure Rclone by [following this walkthrough](sync-files-with-rclone/)
* [x] Read through the [Restic-Rclone documentation here](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030\_preparing\_a\_new\_repo.html#other-services-via-rclone)

The bucket for the backup needs to exist before using Restic. Use Rclone to create the bucket:

```
$ rclone mkdir storj:bucket
```

The general backend specification format is `rclone:<remote>:<path>`, the `<remote>:<path>` component will be directly passed to Rclone. When you configure a remote named `foo`, you can then call Restic as follows to initiate a new repository in the path `bar` in the repo:

```
$ restic -r rclone:foo:bar init
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Restic will take care of starting and stopping Rclone for your backup
{% endhint %}

## Setup

First, [install](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/020\_installation.html) Restic for your operating system, then execute the init command:

```
restic --repo rclone:storj:bucket/my-backup init
```

Flag `--repo` defines that we will use  `rclone` as a tool for backup with `storj` configuration. The last part `bucket/my-backup` specifies where our backup will be stored remotely.&#x20;

The label `storj` refers to the `rclone` configuration name which you chose during setup.&#x20;

Now, enter a password for your repository.

{% hint style="info" %}
Remembering your password is important! If you lose it, you wonâ€™t be able to access data stored in the repository.
{% endhint %}

Repository data will be created directly at the specified bucket prefix e.g. `bucket/my-backup`.

Now you are ready to do your first backup!

## Backing Up

Execute the backup command:&#x20;

```
restic --repo rclone:storj:bucket/my-backup backup ~/directory-to-backup
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
When backing up the root directory on Unix systems it is important to pass `--one-file-system` to prevent accidentally backing up virtual filesystems like`/proc`.
{% endhint %}

You will be able to see the progress of the backup and a summary at the end of the process.

## Cleanup

With every backup, Restic is creating a new snapshot with contents of a directory at the moment. To remove old and unused snapshots we need to execute the `forget` command:

```
restic --repo rclone:storj:bucket/my-backup forget --keep-last 2 --prune
```

The `--keep-last` flag is for keeping last `n` snapshots. This command offers multiple flags for defining deletion rules. See `restic help forget` for more options.

The `--prune` flag is for removing unreferenced data. Without this option, the `forget` command will remove the snapshot but not the referenced data.

## Check

If you want to verify the consistency of your backup, run the `check` command:

```
restic --repo rclone:storj:bucket/my-backup check
```

## Restore

To restore the latest snapshot of your backup:

```
restic --repo rclone:storj:bucket/my-backup restore latest --target ~/restore
```

The `latest` option means we want to restore the latest snapshot.&#x20;

The `--target` flag defines the directory where the backup will be restored.
