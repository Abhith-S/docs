# Simplify File Management with S3 Browser and Storj DCS

S3 Browser is a Windows-based client that provides simple and reliable file management for AWS S3 storage and [AWS S3 compatible storage such as Storj DCS](https://www.storj.io/blog/what-is-s3-compatibility). Via the intuitive web file management interface, users can store and retrieve files from their Storj DCS bucket anytime and anywhere.

While S3 Browser is free for personal use, users who wish to utilize the S3 Browser in commercial, business, government, or military institutions, or for any other profit activity, must purchase a pro license.

Keep in mind that to get the best performance in using S3 Browser to manage your Storj buckets, you’ll want to apply some additional configurations to your S3 Browser instance.

S3 Browser can be configured to download large files via multiple parallel threads. By default, S3 Browsers will download everything using 5MB chunks, whereas, you have the configuration option to increase that download size to 64MB, the segment size for Storj. We suggest configuring your S3 Bucket instance to _**Enable Multipart downloads with part size (in megabytes)**_ of 64. You can find more on configuring this option [here](https://s3browser.com/multipart-downloads.aspx).

{% hint style="info" %}
One license allows you to install one instance of S3 Browser on a single computer. Your license can be transferred if you change your PC. The license is a lifetime license and includes one year of free upgrades and support. Users are also limited to two accounts added within the free version of S3 Browser.

### Generate Credentials to the Gateway MT

Users interested in accessing their Storj DCS bucket(s) via S3 Browser can do so via the hosted AWS multitenant gateway known as Gateway MT. This backward-compatible hosted gateway is one of the most versatile ways to get up and running with Storj DCS when using platforms such as S3 Browser or other file manager platforms that support Storj DCS.

**Gateway MT offers the following:**

* Encryption, erasure coding, and upload to nodes occur server side
* Supports parallelism for upload and multi transfer for download
* A 1GB upload will result in 1GB of data being uploaded to storage nodes across the network based on the S3 standard

Navigate to the [**Access**](../getting-started/satellite-developer-account/access-grants.md) page within your project and then click on **Create Access Grant +.**

Once you’ve selected **Create Access Grant,** a new window will pop up where you can enter a name for this access grant.

Assign the permissions you want this access grant to have, then click on **Continue in Browser**:

![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-LmlDzFHYn9g\_f2QxmPe-887967055%2Fuploads%2FYntUQ4tviuRhVZkbeIMy%2Fimage.png?alt=media\&token=2430d3be-e395-47a8-a50e-c12c142ad169)

If you click **Continue in Browser**, our client-side javascript will finalize your access grant with your encryption passphrase. Your data will remain end-to-end encrypted until you explicitly register your access grant with Gateway MT for S3 compatibility. Only then will your access grant be shared with our servers.

If you already have created other access grants before, please enter the Encryption Passphrase you used for your other access grants in the **Enter Phrase** tab. If this is your first access grant, we strongly encourage you to use a mnemonic phrase as your encryption passphrase. The GUI will automatically generate one on the client-side for you if you open the **Generate Phrase** tab, as shown in the screenshot below. Be sure to save the encryption phrase in a safe place.

Storj does not know or store your encryption passphrase. However, if you are still reluctant to enter your passphrase into our web application, that’s completely understandable, and you should select **Continue in CLI** and follow [these instructions](../getting-started/quickstart-uplink-cli/generate-access-grants-and-tokens/generate-a-token.md).
