Please note, the payment will be accounted only after some amount of confirmations on the Ethereum network and then Payment processor will send them to your balance. This could take from minutes and up to 4 hours. If it took longer or you sent not enough - please [contact the Payment processor support](https://www.coinpayments.net/help-support).
