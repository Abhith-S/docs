# Users

If you need to collaborate with other developers on a project, you can add other developers who have an account on the same Satellite as your project.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you add another user to your project, that user will have full access to the Project Dashboard, Object Browser, and access Grants for your Project.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Navigate to the Users screen.&#x20;
