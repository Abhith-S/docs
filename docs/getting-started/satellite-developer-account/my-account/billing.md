## Introduction

The [_**Billing**_](billing.md) screen allows you to see all your projects and their estimated charges for the **Current Billing Period**, the Invoices for **Previous Billing Periods** and the **Billing History**. You can also see the **Available Balance**, **Balance History** and [**Free Credits**](../../../billing-payment-and-accounts-1/storj-token/promotional-credits.md#credits). At the bottom you can see and add [**Coupons**](../../../billing-payment-and-accounts-1/storj-token/promotional-credits.md#coupons).&#x20;

You can find the billing screen by clicking on _**My Account**_ at the bottom of the left side menu, and selecting **Billing** from the dropdown.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (21) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We will automatize STORJ payments in the near future, but for now, you will need to [contact support](https://supportdcs.storj.io/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket\_form\_id=360000683212) to request paying in STORJ tokens.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that the limits will not increase automatically, you will need to specify the desired limits in the [support request](https://supportdcs.storj.io/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket\_form\_id=360000683212). The allowed limits [depend on your balance and payment method](../../../concepts/limits.md).
{% endhint %}

After you have deposited the needed amount of STORJ, they will be added to your **Available Balance** in USD value via your support request.

### Viewing the Balance History

You can see a **Short Balance History** right in the _**Billing**_ screen below the **Payment Method** section.

To see the full **Balance History,** you can select it with the arrow drowdown next to **Available Balance** at the top of the _**Billing**_ screen.

This will show the **Balance History** page.

You can view STORJ deposit details with the **Checkout** button.

### Adding a Card

You can also select to **Add Card** on the _**Billing**_ screen. You will be prompted to specify Card details.

Please provide a valid Card number, expiration date and CVC, then confirm adding the Card with the **Add Card** button. Storj does not store your card details, they are only used to register your Card with our payment processor [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).

## Add Coupons

You can **Add a Coupon Code** or scan it:
