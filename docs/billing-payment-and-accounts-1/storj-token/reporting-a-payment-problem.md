# Reporting a Payment Problem

We use best-in-class partners for payment processing (Stripe for credit card payments and STORJ deposits). Still, sometimes unanticipated issues can arise.

If the issue is with a credit card payment, please start by submitting a support ticket through our [Storj DCS support portal](https://supportdcs.storj.io/hc/en-us/requests/new). We will attempt to resolve the issue prior to escalating with Stripe.

If the issue is with a STORJ token transaction, submit a support ticket through our [support portal](https://supportdcs.storj.io/hc/en-us/requests/new), including any documentation you have for the STORJ token transaction.
