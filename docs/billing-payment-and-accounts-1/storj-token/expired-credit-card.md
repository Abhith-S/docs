# Expired Credit Card

If the default credit card on an account expires, an email will be sent to the registered email address on the account notifying the owner of the account that the credit card has expired. If a secondary credit card has been added to the account, the secondary card will be charged for any usage fees, and service will not be interrupted. If a secondary card is not added and the user did not enable a STORJ payment method, a valid payment method must be added to the account.

All unpaid balances must be paid via a valid payment method in a billing cycle. Note that if no valid payment method remains on an account, usage limits may be reduced to zero. Data stored on an account with no valid payment method is subject to the data retention policy described below.\
