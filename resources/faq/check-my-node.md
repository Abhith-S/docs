# How do I check my node when I'm away from my machine?

In a future update, we'll have e-mail notifications for when your Node goes down. Until then, a great way to stay updated with your Node's status is to use [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com).&#x20;

UptimeRobot will check to see if your port is listening every x minutes. When your port is not listening, you will receive an e-mail alerting you that your port is closed, meaning there's something going on with your Node. To get started, [sign up for an account](https://uptimerobot.com/signUp).

Once signed up, head over to your UptimeRobot [dashboard](https://uptimerobot.com/dashboard#mainDashboard), and on the top left of the screen, select **Add New Monitor**

Next, select **port** in the **Monitor Type** dropdown, then enter your Node information

Select the e-mail you want the alerts to be sent to, then click **Create Monitor**

You will now receive e-mail alerts when the port closes or opens. You can view more information and history of downtime in the [dashboard](https://uptimerobot.com/dashboard#mainDashboard).
